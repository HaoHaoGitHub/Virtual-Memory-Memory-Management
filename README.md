# Virtual-Memory-Memory-Management
Operating System Project 

In this project, we simulated a variety of memory management systems, including
contiguous, non-contiguous, and virtual memory. In an operating system, each process has specific
memory requirements. These memory requirements are met (or not) based on whether free memory
is available to fulfill such requirements.
